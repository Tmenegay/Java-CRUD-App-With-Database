The purpose of this application is to supply a ficitonal doctor/dental office with an application that can Create, Read, Update, and Delete data from a MySQL database. 
This office is international and may have locations in French speaking Canada, as well as the US and UK, so it must be able to detect whether or not the user speaks 
French or English. I also have created reports based on data within the database which may prove useful in future endeavors. 

When you first load the program, you'll be presented with a login page, which will only accept a valid login input. When you successfully login, you'll be sent to the
main menu, which is 4 buttons: Appointments, Customers, Reports, and Close. Appointments will open a form to create, read, update, and delete appointments. Customers will 
open a form to create, read, update, and delete customers. If a user deletes a customer it will delete appointments associated with that customer. The Reports form will 
populate reports data using 3 tabs. For the report that I came up with myself, I chose to list customers by the countries they are from.
